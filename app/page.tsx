                        The os.c marketplace is THE place to publish open source code with one idea in mind:
                        To reduce the incredible duplication of efforts that really slows down innovation in the AECO industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea of this space is to collect a mix of open source projects. 
                        Small scripts, that you wish you would have at hand instead of building it yourself.
                        Larger projects, that help you move faster.
                        Any code, that is helpful to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very soon, you will be able to push your open source code via GitHub to our website. 
                        We will include your project in the newsletter and organise an community call to make you and your code known. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This way, you will find code.
                        But also heaps of talented people, ready to push the
                        industry further. 
                        Step by step and never stopping.

                        <p>
                            opensource.construction is a non-profit organisation based in
                            Zurich, Switzerland.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initiative was launched by Maximilian Vomhof in 2022 - out of
                            frustration with the current status quo of innovation in the
                            construction industry and with a strong passion for open
                            collaboration.

                            but surely – always with a strong focus on delivering value to the
                            community of software developers, digital doers and established
                            organisations that seek to thrive.
