How exactly does open source work in the construction industry? What contribution can real estate developers, construction and manufacturing companies, architects, investors and other companies make in order to benefit maximally from the numerous possibilities? Should the main focus be on open source software or rather on open data? What should be shared so that joint development can take place? What can be shared at all from a legal point of view?

These questions and topics were discussed at the first community event on 1 November 2022. Initial approaches to solutions were sketched out in various working groups and presented back to the community. These are now being continuously challenged and further developed.
