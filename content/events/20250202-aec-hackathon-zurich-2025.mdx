Our first hackathon in Zurich was a huge success with over 250 hackers and visitors. We are super happy that we managed to bring the same energy and innovation to our recent Hackathon in Munich, organised together with the TUM Venture Lab. 
And now it's time to roll up our sleeves again and get to work in Zurich, where this year’s AEC Hachathon will again be hosted by the [ZHAW Institute of Building Technology and Process](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/archbau)!

This time, the [Institute for Digital Construction and Wood Industry](https://www.bfh.ch/en/research/research-areas/institute-digital-construction-wood-industry/) from Berner Fachhochschule, led by Katharina Lindenberg, will join us as Key Partner for the Friday session. In this session, we will investigate the potential for code-based collaboration in the wood industry. Can this kind of collaboration help to secure the technological advantages of the swiss timber industry? Come by and find out with us! 

From February 07-09, 2025, expect a thrilling event where the brightest minds in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction come together to innovate and collaborate. It will be a weekend filled with creative problem-solving, hands-on workshops, and opportunities to network with industry leaders and experts committed to driving innovation in the AEC sector.

Whether you're a seasoned professional or a passionate student, this hackathon is your chance to shape the future of the AEC industry.

The Hackathon starts on Friday evening. The Hackathon itself is not entirely related to the afternoon's symposium. The beauty of the event is that a variety of different people get together and get to hack with others from outside their organisation or "bubble". 

There will be five sponsored challenges from our partners. In addition, participants have the possibility to announce their own challenge spontaneously as well. If you are considering to bring your own challenge, please get in touch with Max at [max@opensource.construction](mailto:max@opensource.construction).
