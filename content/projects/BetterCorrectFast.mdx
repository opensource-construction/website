### Problem

The BCF format for model-based communication has been around for quite some time, but in practice, its operation is still too slow and user-unfriendly to serve as the main source of communication for decision-makers in construction projects.

### Solution

BetterCorrectFast is a compact Python library with a simple syntax that makes it possible to generate BCF issues using unconventional methods, such as AI LLM models, Grasshopper, and Telegram bots.

### Why Open Source?

BetterCorrectFast has been built on top of the findings of other open-source projects, such as the BCF-schema and IfcOpenShell. BetterCorrectFast is a token of gratitude to those who have contributed to the knowledge that made BetterCorrectFast possible.
