### Overview

Calc is a tool developed by Herzog de Meuron's Design Technologies Group.

It is meant for architects to rapidly assess the environmental impact of early design phases. The open data approach leverages:

- Autodesk Revit for design authoring
- Directus for centralized database management
- Speckle for geometry snapshot handling and 3D dashboard visuals

### Key Features

👪 Role-based data management with Directus UI

🧱 Custom assemblies using material data and Revit model groups

⛑️ Efficient Revit project breakdown via query templates

💞 Seamless assembly-to-model assignment

🤩 Real-time Revit visualization for model branching and assembly validation

🚀 Automated calculations uploaded to Directus using Calc schema
