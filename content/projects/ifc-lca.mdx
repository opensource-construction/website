# Problem

The **construction industry** is responsible for more then **40% of global CO2 emissions** and consumes vast amounts of natural resources. Yet, most building projects lack comprehensive **environmental impact assessment** during the design phase, when changes can still be made cost-effectively.

Architects and engineers need accessible tools to evaluate the **environmental footprint** of their designs using standardized **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies**. However, existing solutions are often expensive, require specialized training, or don't integrate well with standard **BIM workflows** using Ifc models.

We needed a solution that combines the **openBIM approach** with environmental data to make **sustainability analysis** as routine as checking structural loads or energy performance.

# Solution

**IfcLCA** leverages **openBIM** and **Open Data Standards** to analyze the environmental impact of construction projects directly from **Ifc files** using comprehensive **Swiss KBOB** environmental data from lcadata.ch.

Our **web-based platform** allows architects, engineers, and sustainability consultants to upload Ifc models and immediately see the **environmental impact** of their material choices. Whether you're designing a single building or managing multiple projects, you can track **Global Warming Potential (GWP)**, **Primary Energy** consumption, and other key sustainability metrics.

The tool requires **no specialized LCA training** and integrates seamlessly into existing BIM workflows. All processing happens **locally in your browser**, ensuring your project data remains private and secure.

Key capabilities include:

- **Project dashboard** for managing multiple building projects
- **Ifc processing** with compplete material extraction
- **Materials library** with comprehensive environmental data
- **Interactive LCA charts** for visualizing and comparing environmental impacts

# Why Open Source?

**Sustainability is a team effort** that requires trust, transparency, and collaboration across the entire construction industry. Climate change is too urgent for proprietary solutions that limit access to essential environmental analysis tools.

By making IfcLCA open source, we ensure that:

- **Transparency** in environmental calculations and methodologies
- **Accessibility** for firms of all sizes, especially smaller practices
- **Collaboration** on improving sustainability assessment methods
- **Innovation** through community-driven development
- **Trust** through open, auditable environmental data and calculations

The construction industry needs **standardized, open tools** for environmental assessment. Open source ensures these tools remain accessible and continuously improved by the global community working toward **sustainable construction**.

# Technology

IfcLCA is built as a modern web application combining **openBIM** standards with **environmental data science**:

#### Frontend Stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [React](https://react.dev/)** for server-side rendering and modern UI
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for type-safe development throughout the codebase
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **[Clerk](https://clerk.com/)** for user authentication

#### Ifc Processing & LCA Engine

- **[IfcOpenShell WASM](https://Ifcopenshell.org/)** for client-side Ifc file parsing and processing
- **[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)** for running Python LCA calculations in the browser
- **[WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/)** for high-performance Ifc processing
- **KBOB Database Integration** for Swiss environmental impact data from [lcadata.ch](https://lcadata.ch/)

#### Data & Backend

- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** located in Zürich, for storing project data and materials
- **Client-side Ifc processing** ensuring project data privacy

# License

This project is licensed under the **[AGPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)**, ensuring that all modifications and derivative works remain Open Source when distributed.

This means:

- **Free to use** for any purpose, including commercial projects
- **Modify and distribute** the software freely
- **Strong copyleft** ensuring derivative works remain open source
- **Network use provisions** protecting against proprietary SaaS versions

**Why AGPL-3.0?**

We chose the AGPL license to ensure that IfcLCA and any improvements to it remain **accessible to the entire construction community**. The AGPL's network provisions prevent companies from creating proprietary versions while benefiting from community contributions.

This approach ensures that **sustainability tools remain open** and that improvements benefit everyone working toward more sustainable construction practices.

# Operating Model

- **Fully open source** with transparent LCA methodologies and calculations
- **Community contributions** are more then welcome!
- **Open environmental data** using standardized databases like KBOB
- **Collaborative development** on GitHub with public issue tracking

#### Privacy & Data Sovereignty

- **Client-side processing** for Ifc files, no Ifc gets saved
- **No vendor lock-in** with standard file formats and open APIs
- **Project data control** remaining with users and organizations
- **Free forever** for basic LCA functionality

# About the team

**IfcLCA** is developed by **Louis Trümpler**, a passionate advocate for **sustainable construction** and **open solutions**. Combining expertise in **modern software development** and **environmental assessment**, Louis created IfcLCA to make model-based Life Cycle Assessment accessible to the entire AEC community.

The project welcomes contributions from **everyone** who share the vision of **transparent, accessible environmental assessment** for the built environment.
