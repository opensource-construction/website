# Problem

In modern digital construction and planning processes, IFC models are a central source of truth. However, it's often unclear whether a delivered model actually meets the structural and organizational requirements needed for further use — whether for coordination, analysis, or downstream automation. This uncertainty can lead to delays, miscommunication, and a lack of trust in the data.

We frequently encountered the need to quickly and easily verify the integrity and structure of IFC models — without relying on commercial software, complex installations, or time-consuming manual checks. We wanted a solution that empowers everyone involved in the planning process to validate models independently, transparently, and without technical or financial barriers.

# Solution

We developed this open-source model checker to make model validation truly accessible — for everyone involved in the planning and construction process. Whether you're an architect, engineer, BIM coordinator, or client representative, you should be able to check the structure and integrity of your IFC models instantly, securely, and without technical hurdles.

Our tool requires no installation, no login, and stores no data. It runs directly in your browser — and thanks to WebAssembly, all data processing happens locally on your device. Your IFC files never leave your computer, ensuring maximum privacy and security. The data is fully encapsulated within the browser environment, so you stay in control at all times.

In addition to basic structural checks, our model checker also supports IDS (Information Delivery Specification) validation. This allows users to verify whether their models meet specific information requirements — a crucial step for ensuring data quality and compliance in BIM-based processes.

# Why Open Source

IFC is an open standard — and we believe that model checking should follow the same principle. While the core structure of a good model should always be consistent, the specific requirements can vary greatly between projects, disciplines, and phases. That’s why we need a validation tool that is not only transparent, but also adaptable and focused on what truly matters.

By making our model checker open source, we ensure that it remains:

- Transparent – everyone can see how it works and what it checks.
- Adaptable – it can be extended or customized to meet evolving needs.
- Secure – all data stays on the user’s device, with no hidden processes.
- Accessible – free to use, without logins or other limitations.

We deliberately focus on essential features that provide real value — not on offering as many functions as possible. The goal is to help users quickly and easily check what’s relevant, without distractions. Open source allows us to build a tool that is shaped by real-world needs, encourages collaboration, and puts the user first.
