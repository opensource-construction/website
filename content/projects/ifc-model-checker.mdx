# Problem

In modern digital construction and planning processes, **IFC models** are a central source of truth. However, it's often unclear whether a delivered model actually meets the **structural and organizational requirements** needed for further use, be it for coordination, analysis, or downstream automation. This uncertainty can lead to **delays, miscommunication, and a lack of trust** in the data.

We frequently encountered the need to quickly and easily verify the **integrity and structure of IFC models**, without relying on commercial software, complex installations or time-consuming manual checks. We wanted a solution that empowers **everyone involved in the planning process** to validate models independently, transparently, and without technical or financial barriers.

# Solution

We developed this **open-source model checker** to make model validation truly **accessible for everyone** involved in the planning and construction process. Whether you're an **architect, engineer, BIM coordinator, or client representative**, you should be able to check the structure and integrity of your IFC models **instantly, securely, and without technical hurdles**.

Our tool requires **no installation, no login, and stores no data**. It runs directly in your browser, and thanks to **WebAssembly**, all data processing happens **locally on your device**. Your **IFC files never leave your computer**, ensuring maximum privacy and security. The data is fully encapsulated within the browser environment, so you **stay in control at all times**.

In addition to **basic structural checks**, our model checker also supports **[IDS (Information Delivery Specification)](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/information-delivery-specification-ids/) validation**. This allows users to verify whether their models meet **specific information requirements**, a crucial step for ensuring **data quality and compliance** in BIM-based processes.

# Why Open Source

**IFC is an open standard**, and we believe that model checking should follow the same principle. While the core structure of a good model should always be consistent, the **specific requirements can vary greatly** between projects, disciplines, and phases. That's why we need a validation tool that is not only **transparent**, but also **adaptable** and focused on what truly matters.

By making our model checker open source, we ensure that it remains:

- **Transparent** – everyone can see how it works and what it checks.
- **Adaptable** – it can be extended or customized to meet evolving needs.
- **Secure** – all data stays on the user's device, with no hidden processes.
- **Accessible** – free to use, without logins or other limitations.

We deliberately focus on **essential features that provide real value**, not on offering as many functions as possible. The goal is to help users quickly and easily check what's relevant, **without distractions**. Open source allows us to build a tool that is shaped by **real-world needs**, encourages collaboration, and **puts the user first**.

# Technology

The Model Checker is built as a modern web application with privacy and performance at its core:

#### Frontend Stack
- **[React 18](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for type-safe, component-based development
- **[Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/)** as the fast build tool and development server  
- **[Mantine 7](https://mantine.dev/)** UI framework for beautiful, accessible components
- **[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/)** for client-side routing and navigation
- **[Internationalization with i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)** supporting 5 languages (English, German, French, Italian, Romansh)

#### IFC Processing
- **[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)** - Runs Python natively in the browser via WebAssembly
- **[IfcOpenShell](https://ifcopenshell.org/)** - The industry-standard Python library for IFC file processing, loaded as a WASM wheel
- **[IfcTester](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.8.0/src/ifctester)** - Python library for [IDS (Information Delivery Specification)](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/information-delivery-specification-ids/) validation by IfcOpenShell
- **[bcf-client](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.8.0/src/bcf)** - Python library for generating [BCF (BIM Collaboration Format)](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/bim-collaboration-format-bcf/) reports by IfcOpenShell

#### Core Architecture
- **[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)** for non-blocking file processing
- **[WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/)** technology for high-performance Python execution in the browser
- **Client-side processing** - All IFC validation happens locally, no server communication
- **Virtual file system** - Files are processed in memory without touching the user's local storage
