### Problem

Extend the capabilities of one of the most used BIM software (Revit).

### Solution

pyRevit helps you quickly sketch out your automation and add-on ideas, in whichever language that you are most comfortable with, inside the Revit environment and using its APIs. It also ships with an extensive set of powerful tools that showcase its capabilities as a development environment. Download and install pyRevit, launch Revit, and note the new pyRevit tab that includes these tools. pyRevit also ships with a handy CLI utility for customized configuration and deployment of your tools, and a telemetry server to monitor pyRevit usage across your teams.

pyRevit can help you

- Add a powerful set of free tools to your Revit workflows.
- Sketch out your automation ideas quickly in python
- Write your own Revit addons for Revit using python (mostly IronPython and with a limited support for CPython for now), C#, VB.Net
- Distribute your tools (pyRevit, [Dynamo](https://dynamobim.org/), or [Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/inside)) easily to your teams using a unified interface
- Share your tools with the community

### Why Open Source?

The project was started as a passion coding project by Ehsan Iran-Nejad, an architect willing to use and develop his coding skills to make Revit less dumb.

While sharing it publicly, it quickly filled a gap and became a must have tool for Revit Users.

### Technology

- Revit API
- .NET Framework
- Pythonnet
- Python
- C#
- GO (Telemetry server)

### Operating Model

We use GitHub as our code repository, git and issue management system. We are a small team of regular developers, all volunteers for the love of coding and making AEC tools better.
A lot of AEC firms, of every scale, use pyRevit.
The tool is free to use, we do accept donation through Open Collective, [https://opencollective.com/pyrevitlabs](https://opencollective.com/pyrevitlabs)

The money will be used to support the costs and eventually allow us to hire devs for specific area of the development of pyRevit.
