### Problem

Printing PDFs from Autodesk Cloud (BIM360/ACC) is slow and cumbersome.
It involves manually going through all the drawings and requesting PDFs, which is time-consuming for BIM managers who need to ensure the quality of large drawing sets.

### Solution

sPrint is a Chrome extension that allows batch printing of PDFs and downloading derivatives from Autodesk Cloud platforms,
significantly speeding up the process and improving efficiency for BIM managers.
