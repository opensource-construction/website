### Problem
A few players dominate the BIM software market. They have created their solutions from scratch, accumulating technology over decades, making it very hard to compete with them.

### Solution
We are opening up the BIM software market by making the maximum common denominator of all BIM apps open source and free for everyone, so that anyone can easily create top BIM software easily and compete.

### Why Open Source?
We use open source (MIT license) because we believe that it’s the most effective way to achieve our goal to open up the BIM software market.

### Technology
C++ and WebAssembly (core)
TypeScript
Three.js

### Operating Model
We have built a (for profit) company to ensure we have the resources to maintain and advance the open source technology.
Our typical customers are Startups, IT companies and BIM services companies.
For now, we earn money by selling courses teaching how to become a BIM software developer.
