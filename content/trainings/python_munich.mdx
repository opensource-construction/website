This course is an introduction to Python for beginners, where we will cover the basics of the language and programming.
The course is designed for architects and engineers with no prior programming experience, besides an interest in
learning to code.

By the end of the course you will feel comfortable to start writing your own scripts in Grasshopper or creating scripts as replacements
for Excel.

The course stretches over two days in Munich, where we will meet in person, go through presentations and exercises
together.

Learning to code is not something you can learn in two days - it requires practice.

That is why I'm happy to present this course in collaboration with
[opensource.construction](https://opensource.construction) and the [AEC Hackathon Munich](https://opensource.construction/events/aec-hackathon-munich/).

The AEC hackathon is the perfect opportunity to put what you have learned into practice!
You will have the option to meet like-minded AEC professionals with various programming
experience and build something together.

[Christian](https://python.kongsgaard.eu/#about) will be at the hackathon as well, so if you will have the opportunity to ask coding questions
during the hackathon as well.
