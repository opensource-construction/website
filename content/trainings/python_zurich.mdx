This course is an introduction to Python for beginners, where we will cover the basics of the language and programming.
The course is designed for architects and engineers with no prior programming experience, besides an interest in
learning to code.

By the end of the course you will feel comfortable to start writing your own scripts in Grasshopper or creating scripts as replacements
for Excel.

The course stretches over two days in Munich, where we will meet in person, go through presentations and exercises
together.

Learning to code is not something you can learn in two days - it requires practice.

That is why I'm happy to present this course in collaboration with
[opensource.construction](https://opensource.construction) and the [AEC Hackathon Zurich](https://opensource.construction/events/aec-hackathon-zurich-2025/).

The AEC hackathon is the perfect opportunity to put what you have learned into practice!
You will have the option to meet like-minded AEC professionals with various programming
experience and build something together.

[Christian](/#about) will be at the hackathon as well, so if you will have the opportunity to ask coding questions
during the hackathon as well.

## Agenda

### Day 1

The first day will focus on an introduction Python and programming concepts like:
loops, data structures, functions, classes and statements.

- Introduction to Programming

### Day 2

The second day will relate to applying Python to AEC problems and setting you up for success when you return to the office.

### Day 3 and 4

We will participate in the AEC Hackathon

## AEC Hackathon

Get ready for a weekend full of innovation, collaboration, and fun. Whether you're a developer, designer, architect,
engineer, or just passionate about the AEC industry, this event is for you. Join us in person to brainstorm, code,
and create solutions to real-world challenges in the architecture, engineering, and construction fields.

Don't miss this opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and showcase your skills.
Let's hack our way to a better future together!
