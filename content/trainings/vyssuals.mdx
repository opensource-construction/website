## Description
Learn how to use **Vyssuals** effectively to improve your **design**, **convince** clients and **deliver** high-quality BIM models.

## Who is this for?
Intermediate to advanced **Revit users** who want to regain control over the data in their BIM models.

## What is inside?
The training is provided in **a custom online workshop**. 
We'll kick things off with a brief pre-call a couple days in advance to align on the **training objectives** and what's most important to **you and your situation**.
The **main session** will take **3 hours** where we first go through the general workflow for Vyssuals with Revit. Then we get **hands on** while focussing on **your specific setup** to give you the best possible value.

*Architect by Training, Tech Head by Heart*
Over the last 5 years of my professional career working at renowned architecture offices like Herzog & de Meuron, **sharing knowledge was** always a **key** part of my position. I have continuously enjoyed identifying issues in the team's workflows, imagining and creating solutions, and then most importantly: **teaching my colleagues** the improved processes to enable them **to perform their best** and ideally take some load off their shoulders.
